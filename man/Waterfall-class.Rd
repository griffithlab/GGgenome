\arguments{
\item{input}{Object of class MutationAnnotationFormat, or GMS.}

\item{labelColumn}{Character vector specifying a column name from which to
extract labels for cells.}

\item{samples}{Character vector specifying samples to plot. If not NULL
all samples in "input" not specified with this parameter are removed.}

\item{coverage}{Integer specifying the size in base pairs of the genome
covered by sequence data from which mutations could be called. Required for
the mutation burden sub-plot (see details and vignette). Optionally a named 
vector of integers corresponding to each sample can be supplied for more accurate
calculations.}

\item{mutation}{Character vector specifying mutations to keep, if defined
mutations not supplied are removed from the main plot.}

\item{genes}{Character vector of genes to keep}

\item{mutationHierarchy}{Data.table object with rows specifying the order of
mutations from most to least deleterious and column names "mutation" and
"color". Used to change the default colors and/or to give priority to a
mutation for the same gene/sample (see details and vignette).}

\item{recurrence}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying a
mutation recurrence cutoff. Genes which do not have mutations in the
proportion of samples defined are removed.}

\item{geneOrder}{Character vector specifying the order in which to plot
genes.}

\item{geneMax}{Integer specifying the maximum number of genes to be plotted.
Genes kept will be choosen based on the reccurence of mutations in samples.
Unless geneOrder is specified.}

\item{sampleOrder}{Character vector specifying the order in which to plot
samples.}

\item{plotA}{String specifying the type of plot for the top sub-plot, one of
"burden", "frequency", or NULL for a mutation burden (requires coverage to be
specified), frequency of mutations, or no plot respectively.}

\item{plotATally}{String specifying one of "simple" or "complex" for a
simplified or complex tally of mutations respectively.}

\item{plotALayers}{list of ggplot2 layers to be passed to the plot.}

\item{plotB}{String specifying the type of plot for the left sub-plot, one of
"proportion", "frequency", or NULL for a plot of gene proportions frequencies
, or no plot respectively.}

\item{plotBTally}{String specifying one of "simple" or "complex" for a
simplified or complex tally of genes respectively.}

\item{plotBLayers}{list of ggplot2 layers to be passed to the plot.}

\item{gridOverlay}{Boolean specifying if a grid should be overlayed on the
waterfall plot.}

\item{drop}{Boolean specifying if mutations not in the main plot should be dropped from the
legend. If FALSE the legend will be based on mutations in the data before any subsets occur.}

\item{labelSize}{Integer specifying the size of label text}

\item{labelAngle}{Numeric value specifying the angle of label text}

\item{sampleNames}{Boolean specifying if samples should be labeled on the plot.}

\item{clinical}{Object of class Clinical, used for adding a clinical data subplot.}

\item{sectionHeights}{Numeric vector specifying relative heights of each plot section,
should sum to one. Expects a value for each section.}

\item{sectionWidths}{Numeric vector specifying relative heights of each plot section,
should sum to one. Expects a value for each section.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean specifying if status messages should be reported}

\item{plotCLayers}{list of ggplot2 layers to be passed to the plot.}
